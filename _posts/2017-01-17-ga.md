Github Pages offers no traffic analysis for your actual page itself, it will give you traffic analysis for your repository. I use GA every day at work, so why not set it up on my blog. I doubt the insights gained will be that interesting but here we go.

Go to GA and follow their signup process, it is fairly simple; a couple of details, your GitHub pages URL, a terms and conditions agreement and you are done. You'll get your very own GA tracking ID and you are ready to go.

In the _includes folder of your Jekyll directory create a file called 'ga.html'.

(NB: this was not present in my Jekyll directory so I had to create one) 

Into this file paste your GA tracking code.

```html
<script>
(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
})(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');

ga('create', 'UA-XXXXXXXX-X', 'auto');
ga('send', 'pageview');

</script>
```
