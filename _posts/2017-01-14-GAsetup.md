This blog is built using Jekyll and is hosted on Github Pages. Github do not give you a means by which to measure traffic to your blog itself, you can only look at traffic to the blog repo. If you want to measure traffic you will need to implement GA on your blog. Luckily this is fairly easy. I built my blog using Jekyll version 3.2, from this version onwards uses Ruby gem based themes and vastly simplifies the directory structure. Because the very good existing posts out there on this topic didn't allow me to set up GA. How can you tell if you have started your blog post 3.2? These folders will be missing from you blog directory: _layouts, _includes and _sass. If you have these folders I would recommend following one of the many available blog posts on this topic by other authors.

Firstly head over to GA and create a new GA account after some details and a terms and conditions agreement Google will give you your GA tracking code. Which should look like this:

```js
<script>
(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
})(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');

ga('create', 'UA-XXXXXXXX-X', 'auto');
ga('send', 'pageview');

</script>
```
Where UA-XXXXXXXX-X is your GA tracking ID.

Take this code and paste it into the <head> section of your index.html files in your Jekyll directory. You will need to do this for all posts, the homepage, and the about section. This can be quite time consuming. Additionally for any new posts you create you will need to throw the GA tracking code into the index.html file for that post.

One last step and then we are done. You need to paste this line of code into your _config.yml file.

```yaml
# Google services
google_analytics: UA-XXXXXXXX-X
```
Again UA-XXXXXXXX-X is your GA tracking ID.

Alright commit your changes and head over to your GA account. Here you can test whether the tracking is working correctly.

Under the 'Admin' tab click on 'Tracking Info' and then 'Tracking Code' hit the 'Send test traffic' button and GA and if all went as planned you should see this.

Next post I'll take a look at adding some event tracking. Although this is not necessary as the site is static, it will be an interesting learning experience.
