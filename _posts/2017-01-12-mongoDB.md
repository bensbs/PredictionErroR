Non relational databases a.k.a NoSQL are becomingly increasingly prevailant almost standard, at the companies I have worked for we have used SQL databases. In an effor to become familiar with NoSQL in this blog post I'll get mongoDB up and running and see how it


I'm going to use the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Significant Volcanic Eruption Database which contains data on eruptions that meet at least one of the following criteria: caused fatalities, caused moderate damage (approximately $1 million or more), with a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of 6 or larger, caused a tsunami, or was associated with a major earthquake. Why? I studied Geology for my undergraduate degree and volcanoes was always fascinated by them. 

I'll keep it brief on the setup as there are many other excellent guides on how to get mongoDB up and running.

I installed mongoDB using homebrew which makes things very easy. Just a one liner in the terminal. You can also install mongoDB manually - it is fairly straight forwards and the mongoDB documentation is easy to follow.

```bash
brew install mongodb
```
Before making DB you have to create a data directory:

```bash
mkdir -p /data/db
```
Then to run mongoDB:

```bash
mongod
```
This should start a mongo instnace.



To import our data into mongoDB.

```bash
mongoimport --db volcano --collection volerup --drop --file ~/downloads/volerup.json
```

2017-01-14T13:22:57.279+1100	imported 1232 documents

```
Alright data is in. We have 1232 documents in a traditional relational DB this would be a 1232 row table. Let's take a look at the data. I'm going to use the Python Driver pymongo. Install using:

```python
pip install pymongo
```
Time to take a look at our data.

Here we establish the connection to the database.

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient

client = MongoClient()
db = client.volcano
```
To run a simple query with an equality condition. In this case we are looking for eruptions of Volcanic Explosion Index(VEI) of 7. A VEI of 7 is the size of the largest eruption in recent history Mount Tambora, Indonesia 1815. An eruption of this size disrupts global weather, in the cast of Mount Tambora the climatic dsiruption was so great the following year 1816 is known as 'The Year with no Summer'.

```python
cursor = db.volerup.find({"VEI": 7})

for document in cursor:
print(document)
```

``` pythonw
cursor = db.volerup.find({"VEI": 7})

for document in cursor:
print(document)
```
```text

```

There is a lot more to cover as far as querying goes but for now let's try to connect to our mongoDB with Tableau - I find tableau the most effective way to explore data. To do this you'll need to download the mongoDB BI connector. Again mongoDB have made this faily easy and the docs are easy to follow.

Once up and running I wanted to take a look at the geographical distibution of the eruptions. As expected the eruption run along the plate boundaries surrounding the pacific ocean.

In Part 2 of this post I'll user R to query mongoDB.
